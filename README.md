# idea
Working on a Web application that will allow youtubers to make their workspace, add their trusted people like their editors,
who will upload the final draft of the owner's youtube video on this application. This app will then send the message to the owner
and after getting the final allowance, it will push the video to owner's youtube channel.
This will create a hassel free environment for content creators and a clean and trusted way for them to upload their videos.
